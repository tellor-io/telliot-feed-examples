First, create the default configuration files: telliot config init The default configuration files are created in a folder called telliot in the user home folder: Saved config 'main' to ~/telliot/main.yaml Saved config 'endpoints' to ~/telliot/endpoints.yaml Saved config 'chains' to ~/telliot/chains.json To show the current configuration: telliot config show Main Configuration File \u00b6 The main configuration file allows you to choose which network Telliot will interact with. By default, Telliot is configured to run on Rinkeby testnet, as shown in the example below. Edit the ~/telliot/main.yaml config file for the desired configuration. To run on Etherium mainnet, use chain_id: 1 and network: mainnet . To submit values to the Tellor oracle, a private_key must also be configured. Example main configuration file: type : MainConfig loglevel : INFO chain_id : 4 network : rinkeby private_key : '' Configure endpoints \u00b6 Edit ~/telliot/endpoints.yaml to configure Telliot to use your own endpoints. If you don't have an endpoint, a free one is available at Infura.io . Simply replace INFURA_API_KEY with the one provided by Infura. Endpoints should be configured for both Etherium mainnet and Rinkeby testnet. Warning All telliot software and reporter feeds should be validated on Rinkeby prior to deploying on mainnet. Note that endpoints must use the websocket protocol because HTTPS endpoints do not support event listeners.

Once this package is installed and your stakers.yaml and endpoints.yaml have been updated, any of the below commands are available to use. By default, the report command will submit transactions to the public mempool, not through the Flashbots relay, so there's a possibility of being beaten by those submitting through Flashbots. Getting transactions mined by submitting bundles through the Flashbots relay is not a profit guarantee, as those with higher reputation or more sophisticated monitoring can often win out over newer participants. In general, reporting for profit is highly competitive. Overall, this is experimental software, so even if you specify an expected profit percent, you could still lose money if submitting on mainnet! Commands \u00b6 To use any of this package's subcommands, first invoke telliot-examples followed by any subcommands. Help command \u00b6 Use the help command flag to view any subcommands, flag options, and their descriptions: user:~/$ telliot-examples --help Usage: telliot-examples [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]... Telliot command line interface Options: -st, --staker-tag TEXT use specific staker by tag -sgt, --signature-tag TEXT use specific signature account by tag -fb, --flashbots / -nfb, --no-flashbots --help Show this message and exit. Commands: report Report values to Tellor oracle Report command \u00b6 Use the report command to submit data to the TellorX oracle. Here's an example of reporting the USPCE value once: telliot-examples --no-flashbots report --legacy-id 41 --submit-once Each of the command line option flags have shorter versions. For example, the shorter version of --legacy-id is -lid . To report the price of ETH/USD every ~12 hours at an expected profit of 5%: telliot-examples report -lid 1 -p 5 Again, use the help command flag to view any info about these subcommand flag options: user:~/$ telliot-examples report --help Usage: telliot-examples report [OPTIONS] Report values to Tellor oracle Options: -lid, --legacy-id [1|2|10|41|50|59] report to a legacy ID [required] -gl, --gas-limit INTEGER use custom gas limit -mf, --max-fee INTEGER use custom maxFeePerGas (gwei) -pf, --priority-fee INTEGER use custom maxPriorityFeePerGas (gwei) -gp, --gas-price INTEGER use custom legacy gasPrice (gwei) -p, --profit TEXT lower threshold (inclusive) for expected percent profit -tx, --tx-type INTEGER choose transaction type (0 for legacy txs, 2 for EIP-1559) -gps, --gas-price-speed [safeLow|average|fast|fastest] gas price speed for eth gas station API --submit-once / --submit-continuous --help Show this message and exit. Reporting with Flashbots \u00b6 In order to submit transactions through the Flashbots relay, you need an additional private key and the associated account info in stakers.yaml that they'll use to identify you (and for building reputation as a Flashbots searcher). This account doesn't need any funds in it. Here's an example of said signatory account added to stakers.yaml : type : StakerList stakers : - type : Staker tag : my_mainnet_staker address : '0x00001234' private_key : '0x00009999' chain_id : 1 - type : Staker tag : my_rinkeby_staker address : '0x00005678' private_key : '0x00009999' chain_id : 4 - type : Staker tag : flashbots-sig address : '0xthisaddressdoesnotexist' private_key : '0xthisisafakeprivatekey' chain_id : 1 After tweaking your config files, you need to select your mainnet staker as well as the signature account with the --staker-tag/-st and --signature-tag/-sgt CLI flag options, respectively. Also, add the --flashbots/-fb flag: telliot-examples -st my_mainnet_staker -sgt flashbots-sig -fb report -lid 2 -p 10 Tip command \u00b6 Use the tip command to reward reporters for submitting values corresponding to a specific query ID. Like the report command, the --legacy-id/-lid flag is also required to tip. Here's an example of tipping one Tellor Tribute (TRB) for the price of ETH in USD: telliot-examples -lid 1 tip --amount-trb 1 And tipping 4.2 TRB for ETH/JPY: telliot-examples -lid 59 tip -trb 4.2","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"To use any of the telliot datafeed and reporter examples, use the command line interface (CLI) entry point, telliot-examples .
