Install Telliot Feed Examples \u00b6 You can install Telliot Feed Examples and all of it's dependencies (including telliot-core ) through the command line: pip install telliot-feed-examples Telliot Configuration \u00b6 After installation, Telliot must be personalized to use your own private keys and endpoints. First, create the default configuration files: telliot config init The default configuration files are created in a folder called telliot in the user home folder: Saved config 'main' to ~/telliot/main.yaml Saved config 'endpoints' to ~/telliot/endpoints.yaml Saved config 'chains' to ~/telliot/chains.json To show the current configuration: telliot config show Main Configuration File \u00b6 The main configuration file allows you to choose which network Telliot will interact with. By default, Telliot is configured to run on Rinkeby testnet, as shown in the example below. Edit the ~/telliot/main.yaml config file for the desired configuration. To run on Etherium mainnet, use chain_id: 1 and network: mainnet . To submit values to the Tellor oracle, a private_key must also be configured. Example main configuration file: type : MainConfig loglevel : INFO chain_id : 4 network : rinkeby private_key : '' Configure endpoints \u00b6 Edit ~/telliot/endpoints.yaml to configure Telliot to use your own endpoints. If you don't have an endpoint, a free one is available at Infura.io . Simply replace INFURA_API_KEY with the one provided by Infura. Endpoints should be configured for both Etherium mainnet and Rinkeby testnet. Warning All telliot software and reporter feeds should be validated on Rinkeby prior to deploying on mainnet. Note that endpoints must use the websocket protocol because HTTPS endpoints do not support event listeners.
